    The Pi-hole API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).
    Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts and returns reliable UTF-8 [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)-encoded](http://www.json.org/) data for all API responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

    Most (but not all) endpoints require authentication.
    API endpoints requiring authentication will fail with code `401 Unauthorized` when used outside a valid session.
